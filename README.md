# AppFlow API Constants

This library holds a set of constants that can be used with the AEVI AppFlow APIs.

The use of this library is not mandatory but recommended. If there are constants missing,
feel free to raise a pull request for it. If you have questions, please contact AEVI.

Refer to https://github.com/AEVI-AppFlow/pos-android-sdk/wiki for documentation around these constants.
This library is purely a convenience in addition to the relevant documentation.
